\section*{Interests: Further investigations in AI and IoT}
During my time in start-up company Sand Glass Ltd.,  I found myself interested in AI or research being limited to business objectives. It is pointless for a company not to make profit but to do research. However, I admitted that it was an unsuccessful business and also a failure for me because of lack of experience of real IoT development. 

By the time of my studies on Evolutionary Algorithms, I also learned the basics about Machine Learning (ML) in the perspective of leading up to the future. After that, I keep following the latest progress on ML especially in Google Tensorflow. It is essentially the upcoming future technologies for AI and for me. My research experience reminds me of participating in a lab in order to bring us a better future, which makes me feel enthusiastic.

While in my longest working period, I was still dedicated to algorithm design and further studies. For many years, I have been looking for an opportunity that one day I can return to a lab and continue those studies in which I did not sufficiently understand or maybe I could do better.
